    What is Innocent Cleaners?
  faq_what_is_ic_answer:
    Innocent Cleaners is a marketplace for self-employed cleaners in the UK. 
    We help cleaners to find work and homeowners to find cleaners for casual jobs.
    Innocent Cleaners is not an agency, therefore all cleaners are self-employed.
    
  faq_how_hiring_works:
    What happens when I hire the cleaner?
  faq_how_hiring_works_answer:
    When you book a cleaner, we send an sms with the short description of the job.
    The cleaner has one hour to accept or decline the job, which they can do by replying to the sms.
    
  faq_cleaner_declines:
    What if the cleaner does not accept the job?
  faq_cleaner_declines_answer:
    When the cleaner replies to the sms, we text you to let you know of the decision. 
    If the cleaner does not reply within an hour or declines your offer, you are free to attempt to hire another cleaner for the same day.
    
  faq_how_do_i_pay:
    How do I pay the cleaner?
  faq_how_do_i_pay_answer:
    You pay cleaners by cash immediately when the job is done. 
    All money you pay goes to the cleaner, as opposed to the way conventional cleaning agencies that usually take a large cut in cleaners' earnings operate.
    The amount you must pay is shown in My Bookings section of the website.
    
  faq_who_leaves_reviews:
    Who leaves reviews for the cleaners?
  faq_who_leaves_reviews_answer:
    Other users who have hired this cleaner in the past. We aim to verify the authenticity of every review.
    You are welcome to leave a review when the job is done.
    
  faq_are_they_exclusive:
    Are the cleaners listed on the website exclusively available on Innocent Cleaners?
  faq_are_they_exclusive_answer:
    No, they are not exclusive and, therefore, they can decline your offer because they may have other commitments.
  
  faq_bad_result:
    What if I'm not satisfied with the quality of the work?
  faq_bad_result_answer:
    Please discuss this issue with the cleaner on the spot. Since the cleaners are self-employed, they are ultimately responsible for the job.
    Please feel free to leave feedback on the cleaners page if necessary.
