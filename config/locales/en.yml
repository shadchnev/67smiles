    What is Varsity Cleaners?
  faq_what_is_ic_answer:
    Varsity Cleaners is a marketplace for self-employed students working as cleaners in the UK. 
    We help students to earn additional money in their free time.
    Varsity Cleaners is not an agency, therefore all students are self-employed rather than employed by us.
    
  faq_why_students:
    Why hire students as cleaners?
  faq_why_students_answer:
    There are several reasons you want to prefer students over a conventional cleaning agency.
    First, you are helping students to finance their studies.
    Second, students are reliable and can be trusted. They are very unlikely to disappear as opposed to some random person hired as a cleaner.
    Finally, students have a high standard of English, so you'll never have a problem talking to them.
    
  faq_how_hiring_works:
    What happens when I hire the cleaner?
  faq_how_hiring_works_answer:
    When you book a cleaner, we send an sms with the short description of the job.
    The cleaner has one hour to accept or decline the job, which they can do by replying to the sms.
    
  faq_cleaner_declines:
    What if the cleaner does not accept the job?
  faq_cleaner_declines_answer:
    When the cleaner replies to the sms, we text you to let you know of the decision. 
    If the cleaner does not reply within an hour or declines your offer, you are free to attempt to hire another cleaner for the same day.
    
  faq_how_do_i_pay:
    How do I pay the cleaner?
  faq_how_do_i_pay_answer:
    You pay cleaners by cash immediately when the job is done. 
    All money you pay goes to the cleaner, as opposed to the way conventional cleaning agencies that usually take a large cut in cleaners' earnings operate.
    The amount you must pay is shown in My Bookings section of the website.

    What if I'm not satisfied with the quality of the work?
  faq_bad_result_answer:
    Please discuss this issue with the cleaner on the spot. Since the cleaners are self-employed, they are ultimately responsible for the job.
