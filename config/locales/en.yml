    What is Varsity Cleaners?
  faq_what_is_ic_answer:
    Varsity Cleaners is a marketplace for self-employed students currently enrolled at UK universities working as cleaners. 
    We help students to earn additional money in their free time.
    Varsity Cleaners is not an agency, therefore all students are self-employed rather than employed by us.
    You can read about why I started Varsity Cleaners on the <a href='/about-us'>About Us</a> page.
    
  faq_why_students:
    Why hire students as cleaners?
  faq_why_students_answer:
    There are several reasons why you would prefer students over a conventional cleaning agency.
    Firstly, you are helping students to finance their studies.
    Secondly, students are reliable and trustworthy. They are unlikely to disappear as opposed to an unknown, unreferenced cleaner.
    Finally, UK university students have a high standard of English, so you'll never have a problem talking to them.
    
  faq_how_hiring_works:
    What happens when I hire the cleaner?
  faq_how_hiring_works_answer:
    When you book a cleaner, we send an sms with a short description of the job.
    The cleaner has one hour to accept or decline the job, which they can do by replying to the sms.        
    
  faq_cleaner_declines:
    What if the cleaner does not accept the job?
  faq_cleaner_declines_answer:
    When the cleaner replies to the sms, we text you to let you know of the decision. 
    If the cleaner does not reply within an hour or declines your offer, you are free to hire another cleaner for the same day.
    
  faq_how_do_i_pay:
    How do I pay the cleaner?
  faq_how_do_i_pay_answer:
    You pay cleaners by cash or cheque (if the cleaner is fine with that) immediately when the job is done (cheques are payable to the cleaner). 
    All money you pay goes directly to the cleaner. This differs from a conventional cleaning agency that would that usually take a significant cut in cleaners' earnings.
    The amount you pay is shown in the 'My Bookings' section of the website. Please note that this amount is not negotiable, though you are welcome to pay extra if the results exceed your expectations.
    
  faq_who_leaves_reviews:
    Who leaves reviews for the cleaners?
  faq_who_leaves_reviews_answer:
    Other users who have hired the cleaner in the past. We aim to verify the authenticity of every review.
    You are welcome to leave a review when your job is done.
    
  faq_bad_result:
    What if I'm not satisfied with the quality of the work?
  faq_bad_result_answer:
    Please discuss this issue with the cleaner on the spot. Since the cleaners are self-employed, they are ultimately responsible for the job.
    Please leave feedback on the cleaners page if necessary or contact us for advice.

    I have a question not listed here. How can I contact you?

  faq_is_it_flexible:
    Do I have to commit to a certain number of hours per week?
  faq_is_it_flexible_answer:
    No. You can work as much or as little as you want to. You can work more in the summer and you can work less before exams.
    
  faq_do_i_have_to_visit:
    Do I have to visit the site to accept jobs?
  faq_do_i_have_to_visit_answer:
    No. When you get an sms offering you work, you can reply to it to accept or decline it. If you accept, you can log in later to find details of the job.
    
  faq_do_i_have_to_pay_a_commission:
    Do I have to pay for this service?
  faq_do_i_have_to_pay_a_commission_answer:
    No. Right now the service is free both to students and to homeowners.
    
  faq_finance:
    Why many students choose to work as cleaners?
  faq_finance_answer:
    Many undergraduate students struggle to find additional sources of income. Getting a job can be tough if you have no experience, no diploma and also are enrolled on a full-time course. 
    Flexible jobs such as domestic cleaning help them to earn money while not compromising their education.
    
  faq_feedback:
    How can I choose the best cleaner?
  faq_feedback_answer:
    Home owners are invited to leave feedback after each visit from a student cleaner. Please read the reviews before hiring a cleaner but don't be afraid of hiring a student without any reviews.
